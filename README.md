# NIG-LSTM Model

</div>

A hybrid approach to stock price prediction using Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) models combined with LSTM neural networks.

This repository explores the use of stochastic processes and deep learning for stock price prediction, implementing models that integrate mathematical finance and modern machine learning.

# Overview

</div>

Predicting stock prices is challenging due to market volatility and the influence of external factors like sentiment and macroeconomic trends. This project uses a combination of:

  1. Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG): A probabilistic model to capture asymmetric volatility.
  2. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM): A classic stochastic model for simulating price paths.
  3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A deep learning model designed for sequential data like stock prices.
