# NIG_LSTM-Model
These are the set of codes that I have implemented when studying the results of fourier transform and market sentiment in prediction of stock prices. I have also included a model which uses concepts of brownian motion to predict stock prices using an FNN and also Normal Inverse Gaussian with an LSTM.
